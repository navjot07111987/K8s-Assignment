1. Now try to delete the Pods one by one (first voting Pod, then worker pod, then db pod) 
   and see what happens to the voting and result app after deleting
Ans: Earlier results were lost and result app showing 50% each
     Also, result app is not showing any vote now even if i vote from voting app.
2. what happens after db pod deletion
   Db application data is lost after db pod deletion. dp pod come up with new data
3. complete the assignment by making the result pod work. (if you delete db pod, results would not be captured.
   So repeat what we did in the class in order to make the result pod work.).
Ans: Restarted the result pod

Below are command used
kubectl apply -f .  // To launch the application
kubectl delete pod <pod-name> // To delete the vote, worker and db pod
kubectl logs <pod-name> // To check pod logs
kubectl get svc // To verify that nodeport/ClusterIP services
kubectl get deployment // To see the deployments.
